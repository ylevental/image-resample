Minority classes in imbalanced image datasets have been oversampled and classified to improve overall accuracy. The paper DeepSMOTE by Dablain et al. is one recent example, where deep learning is combined with the SMOTE algorithm. In DeepSMOTE, a trained encoder converts the images into embedded vectors. The generated vector classes are oversampled using SMOTE and reconstructed into images with a trained decoder. Accuracy is determined by training a separate CNN model using the oversampled data, and running the model on test data.  However, the authors did not test more complex resampling techniques on the encoded vectors.  We test 14 different resampling algorithms on five different image datasets of varying complexity (MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and iNaturalist) to see which combinations result in the highest overall accuracy for robust classification.  The algorithms either oversample data directly, or resample using multiclass methods. Overall, simpler image datasets and more complex algorithms have the highest accuracies.
